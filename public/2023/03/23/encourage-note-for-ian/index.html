<p>Dear Ian,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment to tell you how proud I am of you. You are growing up so fast and becoming such a wonderful young person. Your curiosity and enthusiasm for learning new things never cease to amaze me, and I know that you will continue to do great things in the future.</p>
<p>I’m so proud of you for trying your best to ride your bike. Even though you fell a few times, you didn’t give up; with practice and persistence, you eventually were able to ride your bike without falling. So far, you have rode your bike for almost 500 miles. Keep up the great work! Remember that you are capable of achieving anything that you set your mind to. It’s important to always try your best and never give up, even when things get tough. Mistakes are just opportunities to learn and grow, so don’t be afraid to make them. You are stronger than you think and capable of overcoming any challenge that comes your way.</p>
<p>I believe in you and your abilities, and I’m excited to see all the amazing things you will accomplish in the years to come. Keep being your wonderful self and never stop reaching for the stars!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Dad</p>
