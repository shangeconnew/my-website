<li>I heard it from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/19/1150075861/authors-explain-how-and-why-to-apologize-the-right-way">All things considered</a></li>

<div id="how-to-appologize-a-good-apology-has-six-parts-maybe-6-12." class="section level2">
<h2>how to appologize: a good apology has six parts, maybe 6 1/2.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>No. 1 is say you’re sorry, not that you regret, not that you are devastated - say you’re sorry.</p></li>
<li><p>The second part is to say what it is that you’re apologizing for. Be specific. And this is important. This gets bungled a lot. People are embarrassed. They want to get it over with. They don’t want to say what they did. They say, oh, that was quite a situation. No, you got to say what it is.</p></li>
<li><p>No. 3 is you’ve got to show you understand why it was bad, which is really difficult. You have to take ownership of the thing and show that you understand why you caused hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>No. 4 is not to make excuses. Excuses can even turn into attacks. So you don’t say, you know, I was having a really bad day and work was horrible and the drive home was - work was horrible. And then, you know, you asked me if I’d seen your shoes, and I’m not your shoe concierge, so of course I went off on you.</p></li>
<li><p>No. 5 is say why it won’t happen again. What steps are you taking?</p></li>
<li><p>No. 6, if it’s relevant, is to make reparation. Say, you know, I’m going to pay for the dry cleaning. Just send the bill to me. I’m going to do my best to fix what I did.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And these six steps are relevant for adults, for children, for corporations, for institutions, for governments. And 6 1/2 is listen. People want to be heard, and don’t jump over them. Let the person that you hurt have their say.</p>
