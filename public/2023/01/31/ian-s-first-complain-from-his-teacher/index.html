<p>Today, I got a message from Juan that Ms. Burger emailed her about Ian’s behavior in his math and reading class today:</p>
<pre><code>Good afternoon, I am Ms. Burger. I am one of the 3rd grade

teachers and I teach Ian in both Math and Reading. I wanted

to reach out because I know that he is very smart, but he 

is not following directions in class. When we go over 

lessons or notes in class, he works ahead of the class and 

myself. I have told the class my expectation is that during 
whole group (20-25 minutes) we work as a class and at the 

same pace. He still works ahead of me and will fill out the 
entire page without my permission. Then he sits and talks 

to others and is distracting. I give the class plenty of 

enrichment activities and challenging work. But, for the 

20-25 minutes of whole class instruction, he needs to be 

working at the pace that I set for the class. He also has 

been following the behaviors of his peers. If they mess 

around, he does too. If they talk over the teacher, he does 
too. I worry that he won&#39;t be as successful as he can be if 
he doesn&#39;t follow the directions. If you have any 

questions, please reach out. Thank you! - Ms. Burger
</code></pre>
<p>Juan replied as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Dear Ms Burger, I am extremely sorry for Ian’s behavior. It is actually a little shocking to see how terrible Ian is in your class, because I always thought he is shy and obedient in school. Now I know and I will definitely find ways to stop him from doing that in the future. He is just a normal kiddo, please don’t give him up. I will sincerely work with you and pull him back to the right route even it has to let him learn in a hard way. I really appreciate your information so that I can take action before it is too late. Thanks again! Juan, Ian’s mom.

<li>we went to Long fitness center for swimming at 5 today since the water heater in Genesis is broken. Ian is under huge pressure since he is only one from Manhattan and the rest of team swims very fast-I even asked him to have a break. Ian told me that he does not like the pool.</li>
