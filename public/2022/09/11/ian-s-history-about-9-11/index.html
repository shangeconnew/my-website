<h2>9/11</h2>
<p>In the morning, he asks me “Is today 9/11?”; after I say “yes”, he says “then today is the <span class="math inline">\(21^{th}\)</span> anniversary of 9-11!” I just realize that he is right: 21 years have passed since the big event happened in 2001. I am very curious about how he knows that and ask him “How do you know it?”.</p>
<p>“Ms. Mortron was 4 years old when 9/11 happened; now, she is 25.”Ms. Mortron is his main teacher. At that moment, I really appreciate Ms. Mortron’s teaching history to the kids on such a nice way. To continue, I ask him “how much do you know about 9/11?”</p>
<p>He then shares with me that two airplanes hit the Twin Tower and the third one tried to hit the Pentagon but failed.</p>
<p>“Who did the 9/11?”</p>
<p>“That is a good question, what did Ms. Mortron say about it?”</p>
<p>“I forgot to ask her the question in class!” then I have to tell him something like alqueda. What he says next really shocks me.</p>
<p>“they’re bad guys, but they died also since the whole plane crashed.”</p>
<p>He asks me “what happens to the Twin Tower now?”</p>
<p>“They’re cleared off and now there is memorial museum for 9/11” I plan to find the paper from Raz-kids for him to read.</p>
<p>“Is the Empire State Building still there?”</p>
<p>After I say “yes”, he tells me something about the building. He also shares me with a story about Ms. Mortron: her grandma got hit in the head by a flying quater from Empire State Building and died. I don’t think that is true, but I cannot confirm ti by asking Ms. Mortron next time when I meet her?</p>

<li><p>Ms. Mortron is a great teacher.</p></li>
<li><p>actually, I do not know too much about 9/11: I even thought there was only one airplane hitting the Twin Tower. But I remember exactly the day when I first got know the event by VOA radio.</p></li>
<li><p>last years, it was 20th anniversary and a lots of programs were going on about it. but this year,not too much; plus, I am very busy and get no time to listen to NPR.</p></li>
