<li>Course website: <a href="https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/114308">\blc Canvas @ Kansas State University \rc </a>, this will contain a bulletin board, lecture slides, homework assignments, reading list, R, R Studio, R Markdown resources etc. Questions can also be posted on <a href="https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/114308/discussion_topics">Canvas Discussion</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>An intermediate statistics course, such as<a href="https://www.k-state.edu/stats/academics/courses.html">STAT 705</a> or <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/stats/academics/courses.html">STAT 713</a> or equivalent; Students should be familiar with summary statistics, hypothesis testing, point estimation, interval estimation (confidence intervals), basics of statistical inference, and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">R</a>.</p>
<h2 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>
<p>Nonparametric statistical methods combine the theory and application of commonly used distribution-free test statistics, density and function estimation methods. Analysis of data from problems in many fields such as agricultural science, biology, education, engineering environmental science, medicine, physics, and psychology are some important examples. This course will provide you with the basic theory and computing tools to perform nonparametric tests including the sign test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test, as well as the corresponding nonparametric point and interval estimation. Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests for one-way and two-way analysis of variance, multiple comparisons, dispersion and independence problems are other nonparametric tests covered. Other topics include estimation methods for nonparametric density estimation, regression, and computing as they relate to nonparametric statistics and bootstrapping. Although some theory behind these methods will be covered, the course will focus upon application of nonparametric methods with the statistical software package R.</p>
<h2 id="course-objective">Course Objective</h2>
<p>By the end of the course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the differences between parametric and non-parametric methods
and the advantages and disadvantages with each method.</li>
<li>Perform nonparametric goodness-of-fit tests in R.</li>
<li>Perform rank tests of location in one-sample, two-sample and multiple-sample
settings in R.</li>
<li>Perform nonparametric tests for contingency tables in R.</li>
<li>Perform any one or two-sample permutation test in R.</li>
<li>Use the jackknife and bootstrap in R to estimate the bias and variance of commonly
used estimators.</li>
<li>Compute kernel regression estimators in R.</li>
<li>Critically evaluate published results based upon nonparametric methods</li>
<li>Present and communicate, both orally and in written-form, the results of nonparametric statistical analyses of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this course, we will use R for computing and R Markdown for producing lecture slides, solutions for homework assignments. R Markdown is highly recommended to write the solutions for homework assignments. Install the following software:
<ul>
<li>R (required): <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</a>.</li>
<li>R Studio is highly recommended for syntax highlighting, package management, document generation, and more: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</a>.
<ul>
<li>The newest version of R Studio is highly recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Latex, which will enable you to create PDFs directly from the R Markdown in RStudio.
<ul>
<li>Install <a href="https://yihui.name/tinytex/">\blc TinyTex\bc</a> package: <code>install.packages(&quot;tinytex&quot;)</code>.</li>
<li>After installing <a href="https://yihui.name/tinytex/">\blc TinyTex\bc</a>, close RStudio.</li>
<li>Reopen RStudio.</li>
<li>Run the following: <code>tinytex::install_tinytex()</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>There will be $6$ homework assignments with each worth $50$ points. The
assignments are very important for learning and understanding the material,
which is why they receive a relatively high weight in the grading scheme. I
do not mind if you work with others on the assignments, but each of you
should turn in your own R markdown and PDF files on the course website. Note that all assignments are on the course
website with specified due time. Late assignment will NOT be accepted
without valid excuse.</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p>There will be one in class midterm exam. Midterm is worth $100$ points and
will be given on <strong>Oct. 28 (Thursday)</strong> in our usual
classroom: 146 CW. Makeup exam would only be issued with valid excuse and
the instructor should be notified at least two weeks ahead, or within 24
hours of originally scheduled exam date for a fully documented emergency
reason; otherwise, the grade for the missed exam would be zero. The exam will be closed book and closed note, but you
will be allowed to bring two double-sided formula sheets ($8.5$ inch by $11$ inch)
and a calculator. No electronics/tablets are allowed in the exam.</p>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Guidelines: the goal of this project is to allow you make a connection
between course topics and your particular research interests. It
may be based on the analysis of a reliable data set, as long as you&rsquo;re not
doing the same thing as in another course, and the data meet course
standards (we can discus individually). It may be based on a review of a
particular topic we have covered, either with or without a focus on your
discipline. It may include the development of a research proposal , or
review report of a published journal article. There may be other types of
projects you can pursue, and I am open to considering them. Again, our
interest with this is on transfer of training and application of course
materials to your own areas of interest. The project is worth $100$ points.</li>
<li>Due Dates:
<ul>
<li>the proposal due by <strong>5pm Friday, Nov. 19</strong>;</li>
<li>the slides due by <strong>5pm Friday, Dec. 10</strong>;</li>
<li>the presentation at <strong>2 p.m. - 3:50 p.m. Thursday, Dec.16</strong>;</li>
<li>the final writeup due by <strong>5pm Friday, Dec. 17</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grades:
<ul>
<li>the proposal: $20$;</li>
<li>the slides: $30$;</li>
<li>The presentation: $25$;</li>
<li>the final writeup: $25$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading-scheme">Grading Scheme</h2>
<p>There are $500$ points in total in this course, including $300$ of HW
assignments, $100$ points of exam and $100$ points of project. Your course&rsquo;s

<h2 id="instructors-advice">Instructor&rsquo;s Advice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Come to class as possible as you can; It takes time to learn to work
problems.</li>
<li>Cramming doesn&rsquo;t work: Just a little time week by week will be much
more effective than spending the same amount of time  before a deadline.</li>
<li>The best way to get a hold of me is by email or by stopping by my
office hours. As for your email, put &ldquo;\textbf{STAT 716}:
Key words of your question&rdquo; as the subject. I will check my email as much as
possible from 9am to 6pm during the weekdays, but I make no
guarantees about reading or responding on the same day to emails sent later
at night or over the weekend.</li>
<li>The biggest expectation I can have of you is to ask questions! Please!
I promise you that $99%$ (is that a statistic!?) of the time multiple
people are confused about the same thing as you. Or at the very least, one
question may cause other questions to be asked. This is a good thing! I try
to take all questions seriously as long as they are asked seriously. Other
than that, just be excellent to each other in class and we will get through
this class just fine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration,
acknowledge the jurisdiction of the <a href="www.ksu.edu/honor">\blc Honor System \bc</a>.
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and
part-time students enrolled. A grade of <strong>XF</strong> can result from a breach
of academic honesty.The <strong>F</strong> indicates failure in the course; the <strong>X</strong> indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p>
<h2 id="special-accommodations">Special Accommodations</h2>
<p>Any student with a disability that needs a classroom accommodation,
access to technology or other assistance in this course should
contact Disability Support Services and/or their instructor. (DSS is
located in Holton Hall 202)</p>
<h2 id="expectations-for-classroom-conduct">Expectations for Classroom Conduct</h2>
<p>All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.</p>
<h2 id="wearing-of-face-masks">Wearing of Face Masks</h2>
<p>All students are expected to comply with K-State’s face mask policy. As of August 2, 2021, everyone must wear face masks over their mouths and noses in all indoor spaces on university property, including while attending in-person classes. This policy is subject to change at the university’s discretion. For additional information and the latest on <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/covid-19/guidance/health/face-covering.html">\blc K-State’s face covering policy\bc</a>.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I reserve the right to change the syllabus as
circumstances necessitate, it is your responsibility to keep up with any
changed policies announced in class or other form of notification.</em></p>
