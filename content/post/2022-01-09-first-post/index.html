<div id="first-one" class="section level2">
<h2>first one</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Every number in <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span> has a ternary expansion</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_k}{3^k},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\({a_k}=0,1,2\)</span></p>
<p>Prove that <span class="math inline">\(x\in\mathcal{C}\)</span>, the Cantor set, if and only if x has a representation as above where every ak is either <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Proof. (⇒) Let <span class="math inline">\(x\in\mathcal{C}.\)</span> We build a ternary expansion for x of the desired form as follows.Consider C1. It must
be that x belongs to one of <span class="math inline">\([0,\frac{1}{3}]\)</span> (in which case let first digit of the ternary expansion for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) or <span class="math inline">\([ \frac{2}{3},1]\)</span> (in
which case let first digit of the ternary expansion for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>). Next, consider C2. The interval of C1 to which
x currently belongs will be divided into three subintervals, and so we append a 0 to the ternary expansion
of x if it belongs to the leftmost subinterval or a 2 if it belongs to the rightmost subinterval. Continuing in
this way, we see that x has an associated ternary expansion containing only the digits 0 and 2.</p>
<p>(⇐) Let<span class="math inline">\(x=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_k}{3^k},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\({a_k}=0,1,2\)</span></p>
<p>We can locate x on the real line as follows. If a1 = 0, we choose the left subinterval of C1. If a1 = 2,
we choose the rightmost subinterval of C1. When we form C2, the interval we have just chosen will be
subdivided into three subintervals. If a2 = 0, we select the leftmost subinterval. If a2 = 2, we select the
rightmost subinterval. Continue in this way. Since the length of these intervals can be made arbitrarily
small, we see that the ternary expansion of x uniquely specifies its location on the real line.</p>
