1. Today it's the first day of Ian's swimming in City Park pool; he got out of pool at least 10 minutes earlier than scheduled time-11:50. He said he felt too cold.

2. When I picked up him at the art center, he shared with me what they learned in the camp today. The three  geologic periods related to dinosaurs:

- [Permian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian)二叠纪

- [Triassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic)三叠纪

- [Jurassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic)

- [Cretaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous)白垩纪
