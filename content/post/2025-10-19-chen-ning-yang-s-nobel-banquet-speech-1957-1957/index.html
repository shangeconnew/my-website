<p><strong>Chen Ning Yang’s speech at the Nobel Banquet in Stockholm, December 10, 1957</strong></p>
<p>Chen Ning Yang
Banquet speech</p>
<p>Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
<p>First of all allow me to thank the Nobel Foundation and the Swedish Academy of Sciences for the kind hospitality that Mrs. Yang and I have so much enjoyed. I also wish to thank especially Professor Karlgren for his quotation and his passage in Chinese, to hear which is to warm my heart.</p>
<p>The institution of the awarding of Nobel prizes started in the year 1901. In that same year another momentous event took place of great historical importance. It was, incidentally, to have a decisive influence on the course of my personal life and was to be instrumental in relation to my present participation in the Nobel festival of 1957. With your kind indulgence I shall take a few minutes to go a little bit into this matter.</p>
<p>In the latter half of the last century the impact of the expanding influence of Western culture and economic system brought about in China a severe conflict. The question was heatedly debated of how much Western culture should be brought into China. However, before a resolution was reached reasons gave way to emotions, and there arose in the eighteen nineties groups of people called I Ho Tuan in Chinese, or Boxers in English who claimed to be able to withstand in bare flesh attack of modern weapons. Their stupid and ignorant action against the Westerners in China brought in 1900 the armies of many European countries and of the U.S. into Peking. The incident is called the Boxer War and was characterized on both sides by barbarous killings and shameful lootings. In the final analysis, the incident is seen as originating from an emotional expression of the frustration and anger of the proud people of China who had been subject to ever increasing oppression from without and decadent corruption from within. It is also seen in history as settling, once and for all, the debate as to how much Western culture should be introduced into China.</p>
<p>The war ended in 1901 when a treaty was signed. Among other things the treaty stipulated that China was to pay the powers the sum of approximately 500 million ounces of silver, a staggering amount in those days. About ten years later, in a typically American gesture, the U.S. decided to return to China her share of the sum. The money was used to set up a Fund which financed a University, the Tsinghua University, and a fellowship program for students to study in the U.S. I was a direct beneficiary of both of these two projects. I grew up in the secluded and academically inclined atmosphere of the campus of this University where my father was a professor and enjoyed a tranquil childhood that was unfortunately denied most of the Chinese of my generation. I was later to receive an excellent first two years’ graduate education in the same University and then again was able to pursue my studies in the U.S. on a fellowship from the aforementioned fund.</p>
<p>As I stand here today and tell you about these, I am heavy with an awareness of the fact that I am in more than one sense a product of both the Chinese and Western cultures, in harmony and in conflict. I should like to say that I am as proud of my Chinese heritage and background as I am devoted to modern science, a part of human civilization of Western origin, to which I have dedicated and I shall continue to dedicate my work.</p>
<p>Prior to the speech, B. Karlgren, Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, addressed the laureate: Mr Lee and Mr Yang, allow me to address a few congratulatory words to you. For 50 years I have studied the literature, history and art of your country and I cannot but whole-heartedly admire and love it. Your culture of 3 000 years is really as it is said in the sacred ancient hymn: “like the Kiang river, like the Han river, massive like the mountains, voluminously flowing like the rivers.” Now you two great scholars have demonstrated that your country still today possesses men with just as keen a power of intellect as the great thinkers of Ancient China. I think that all Chinese, irrespective of regimes, will be sure to admire you and say about you, in the words of a famous T’ang poet: “how can we for a single day do without these men.”</p>

<p><strong>杨振宁1957年诺贝尔晚宴致辞</strong></p>
<p>尊敬的国王陛下，王室成员，女士们，先生们：</p>
<p>首先，请允许我感谢诺贝尔基金会和瑞典皇家科学院的盛情款待，使我和杨夫人度过了愉快的时光。我尤其要感谢卡尔格伦教授，他引用并朗诵的那段中文令我倍感温暖。</p>
<p>诺贝尔奖制度始于1901年。同年，历史上还发生了另一件极其重要的大事。它不仅对世界格局产生深远影响，也对我的个人命运产生了决定性的作用，并且在某种意义上促成了我今天能够参加1957年的诺贝尔庆典。请允许我占用几分钟时间，略作说明。</p>
<p>在十九世纪下半叶，随着西方文化与经济体系在世界范围的扩张，中国也陷入了剧烈的冲突。社会上展开了激烈的争论：究竟应当在多大程度上引入西方文化？然而，这场辩论尚未有结论，理性便被情绪所取代。十九世纪九十年代，中国出现了一些自称“义和团”的民众，他们宣称能以肉身抵御现代武器的攻击。1900年，他们以愚昧与盲目的行动攻击在华的西方人，结果招致包括欧洲各国与美国在内的联军进攻北京。那场战争被称为“义和团之乱”或“庚子之役”，双方都曾犯下残酷的杀戮与可耻的劫掠。从历史的角度看，这场事件反映了一个骄傲的民族在外部压迫与内部腐败双重打击下所产生的愤怒与挫败的情绪。它也被视为一次最终解决“是否接受西方文化”这一争论的事件。</p>
<p>战争于1901年以签订条约而结束。条约规定，中国必须向列强赔偿约五亿两白银——在当时这是一个极其庞大的数字。大约十年后，美国以一种极具美国特色的慷慨举动，将其分得的赔款退还中国。这笔钱用来建立了一个基金，资助成立清华学堂（即后来的清华大学），并设立公费留学计划，派遣学生赴美深造。我正是这两个项目的直接受益者。我在清华园这个幽静而富于学术氛围的校园里长大——我父亲是一名教授。那段宁静的童年，是我那一代中国人中大多数人所不曾拥有的。我后来在清华大学完成了优良的两年研究生学习，又凭借前述基金的奖学金赴美继续深造。</p>
<p>今天，当我站在这里讲述这一切时，我深切地意识到：我在不止一个意义上，都是中西文化的产儿——二者既相互融合，又时常冲突。我为自己所继承的中华文化与传统而自豪，同时我也全身心地献身于现代科学——这门源于西方的人类文明的重要组成部分——并将继续为之努力。</p>
<p>在杨先生致辞前，瑞典皇家科学院院士贝尔蒂尔·卡尔格伦(高本汉)教授曾致词：</p>
<p>“李先生、杨先生，请允许我向你们致以衷心的祝贺。五十年来，我一直研究贵国的文学、历史与艺术，并由衷地钦佩与热爱它。你们三千年的文明，正如古代圣歌所言：‘如江河之流，如山岳之高，浩浩荡荡，绵延无尽。’如今，你们两位杰出的学者，再次向世界展示了中国依然孕育着与古代思想家同样卓越的智慧。无论在何种政体之下，全体中国人都会为你们感到骄傲，并引用唐代诗人的名句称赞道：‘一日不可无此君。’”</p>
