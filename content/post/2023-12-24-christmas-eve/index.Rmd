## Under our neighbour's invitation, we attended the Christmas Eve Service at 4pm

The whole service can viewed here at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i3jJ71_RDs&t=1104s)

I really like the songs (Christmas carols) played-it's like band for pop music:

- 1. **Joy to the World**

```
Joy to the world! the Lord is come;  
Let Earth receive her King;  
Let every heart prepare him room,  
ùÑÜ And heaven and nature sing, ùÑá  
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.  

Joy to the world! the Saviour reigns;  
Let men their songs employ;  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains  
ùÑÜ Repeat the sounding joy, ùÑá  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.  

No more let sins and sorrows grow,  
Nor thorns infest the ground;  
He comes to make His blessings flow  
ùÑÜ Far as the curse is found, ùÑá  
Far as, far as, the curse is found.  

He rules the world with truth and grace,  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness,  
ùÑÜ And wonders of His love, ùÑá  
And wonders, wonders, of His love.  
```

- 2. **Behold Him**

```
He who was before there was light
Walked across the pages of time
He who made every living thing
Behold Him

He who heard humanity's cry
Left His throne to wake as a child
He became like the least of us
Behold Him

Jesus, Son of God, Messiah
The Lamb, the roaring Lion
Oh, be still and behold Him
He who dined with sinners and saints
Healed the blind, the lost and the lame
Even now He is in our midst
Behold Him

He who chose a criminal's end
Paid with blood to settle our debt
Buried death as He rose to life
Behold Him

Jesus, Son of God, Messiah
The Lamb, the roaring Lion
Oh, be still and behold Him
Jesus, Alpha and Omega
Our God, the risen Savior
Oh, be still and behold Him

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy, worthy, worthy
To receive all praise

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy, worthy, worthy
To receive all praise

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy, worthy, worthy
To receive all praise

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy, worthy, worthy
To receive all praise

Jesus, Son of God, Messiah
The Lamb, the roaring Lion
Oh, be still and behold Him
Jesus, Alpha and Omega
Our God, the risen Savior
Oh, be still and behold Him

Behold Him
```

- 3. **Come, Thou long expected Jesus**

```
1. Come, thou long expected Jesus,
born to set thy people free;
from our fears and sins release us,
let us find our rest in thee.
Israel's strength and consolation,
hope of all the earth thou art;
dear desire of every nation,
joy of every longing heart.

2. Born thy people to deliver,
born a child and yet a King,
born to reign in us forever,
now thy gracious kingdom bring.
By thine own eternal spirit
rule in all our hearts alone;
by thine all sufficient merit,
raise us to thy glorious throne.
```

- 4. **Silent Night**

```
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth

```

- 5. **O Come, O Come, Emmanuel**

```
1 O come, O come, Immanuel,
and ransom captive Israel
that mourns in lonely exile here
until the Son of God appear.
Refrain:
Rejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel
shall come to you, O Israel.

2 O come, O Wisdom from on high,
who ordered all things mightily;
to us the path of knowledge show
and teach us in its ways to go. Refrain

3 O come, O come, great Lord of might,
who to your tribes on Sinai's height
in ancient times did give the law
in cloud and majesty and awe. Refrain

4 O come, O Branch of Jesse's stem,
unto your own and rescue them!
From depths of hell your people save,
and give them victory o'er the grave. Refrain

5 O come, O Key of David, come
and open wide our heavenly home.
Make safe for us the heavenward road
and bar the way to death's abode. Refrain

6 O come, O Bright and Morning Star,
and bring us comfort from afar!
Dispel the shadows of the night
and turn our darkness into light. Refrain

7 O come, O King of nations, bind
in one the hearts of all mankind.
Bid all our sad divisions cease
and be yourself our King of Peace. Refrain

Psalter Hymnal (Gray)

- 6. **God With Us**

```
[Verse 1]
Who are we
That You would be mindful of us
What do You see
That's worth looking our way
We are free
In ways that we never should be
Sweet release
From the grip of these chains

[Pre-Chorus]
Like hinges straining from the weight
My heart no longer can keep from singing

[Chorus]
All that is within me cries
For You alone, be glorified
Emmanuel
God with us
My heart sings a brand new song
The debt is paid, these chains are gone
Emmanuel
God with us

[Verse 2]
Lord, You know
Our hearts don't deserve Your glory
But still You show
A love we cannot afford
```

- 7. **O Holy Night**

```
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men from the orient land.
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
In all our trials born to be our friend.
He knows our need, to our weakness no stranger.
Behold your King, before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King, your King, before Him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we;
Let all within us praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! O praise his name forever!
His power and glory evermore proclaim!
His power and glory evermore proclaim!
```
- 8. **O Come Let Us Adore Him**

```
[Verse 1]
O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

[Chorus]
O come all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O come all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him

[Verse 2]
Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heav'n above
Glory to God, glory in the highest
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

[Chorus]
O come all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O come all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O sing hallelujah
Come let us adore Him
O sing hallelujah
Come let us adore Him
```
- Note: the male only sung several lines of the song 8; or maybe a different version.
