## Under our neighbour's invitation, we attended the Christmas Eve Service at 4pm

The whole serice can viewed here at [YouTube](Christmas Eve Service 4pm)

I really like the songs (Christmas carols) played-it's like band for pop music:

- 1. **Joy to the World**

```
Joy to the world! the Lord is come;  
Let Earth receive her King;  
Let every heart prepare him room,  
𝄆 And heaven and nature sing, 𝄇  
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.  

Joy to the world! the Saviour reigns;  
Let men their songs employ;  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains  
𝄆 Repeat the sounding joy, 𝄇  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.  

No more let sins and sorrows grow,  
Nor thorns infest the ground;  
He comes to make His blessings flow  
𝄆 Far as the curse is found, 𝄇  
Far as, far as, the curse is found.  

He rules the world with truth and grace,  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness,  
𝄆 And wonders of His love, 𝄇  
And wonders, wonders, of His love.  
```

- 2. **Behold Him**

```
He who was before there was light
Walked across the pages of time
He who made every living thing
Behold Him

He who heard humanity's cry
Left His throne to wake as a child
He became like the least of us
Behold Him

Jesus, Son of God, Messiah
The Lamb, the roaring Lion
Oh, be still and behold Him
He who dined with sinners and saints
Healed the blind, the lost and the lame
Even now He is in our midst
Behold Him

He who chose a criminal's end
Paid with blood to settle our debt
Buried death as He rose to life
Behold Him

Jesus, Son of God, Messiah
The Lamb, the roaring Lion
Oh, be still and behold Him
Jesus, Alpha and Omega
Our God, the risen Savior
Oh, be still and behold Him

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy, worthy, worthy
To receive all praise

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy, worthy, worthy
To receive all praise

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy, worthy, worthy
To receive all praise

Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy, worthy, worthy
To receive all praise

Jesus, Son of God, Messiah
The Lamb, the roaring Lion
Oh, be still and behold Him
Jesus, Alpha and Omega
Our God, the risen Savior
Oh, be still and behold Him

Behold Him
