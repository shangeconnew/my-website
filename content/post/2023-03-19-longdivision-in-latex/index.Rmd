- I tried to find a way to write long multiplication/division in Latex and found [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/288084/latex-for-elementary-school-mathematics) very interesting;

- There is a `polynom` package, which could even do factorization directly: https://ctan.org/pkg/polynom?lang=en

- for example: 

$2X^3+X^2-7X+3=\polyfactorize{2X^3+X^2-7X+3}$
