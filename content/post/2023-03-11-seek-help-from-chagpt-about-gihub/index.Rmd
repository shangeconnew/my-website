## Introduction

Yesterday to create a course website for world economy, I have a problem which I cannot solve. So I have copy all the files from ChinaWTO course website into WorldEconomy. But it turns out that the original ChinaWTO repository was overwritten. So one problem was solved-the course website for WorldEconomy was fine now but the course website for ChinaWTO was gone!
To escape the problem in the future, I am trying to figure out the reasons behind.

## Q&A between ChatGPT and me

- Q: sync a folder to github, is there a file to control for the repository in github? 

- A: Yes, when syncing a folder to a GitHub repository, you need to create a file called "README.md" in the root of your repository. This file should contain a brief description of your project, including what it does, how to install it, and any other relevant information. This file is displayed prominently on the repository's main page and provides important context for anyone who visits your repository.

Additionally, you may also want to create a file called ".gitignore" in the root of your repository to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control. This can be especially useful if you have files that are generated automatically by your project or that contain sensitive information that should not be shared publicly.

Once you have created the necessary files, you can use Git to add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. The exact steps will depend on your operating system and development environment, but you can find detailed instructions in the GitHub documentation.

- Q: suggest any link to the GitHub documentation?

- A: Sure, you can find the GitHub documentation at the following link:

https://docs.github.com/en

This documentation covers all aspects of using GitHub, including getting started with Git, creating and managing repositories, collaborating with other developers, and more. It's a great resource for anyone who wants to learn how to use GitHub effectively.

- Q: can we retrieve al the files overwritten by sync?

- A: When you sync a folder to a GitHub repository, any files that are already in the repository will be overwritten by the files in the folder that you are syncing. If you have not committed and pushed changes to the repository before syncing, it may be possible to retrieve the previous versions of the files using Git.

To retrieve previous versions of files using Git, you can use the "git log" command to view the commit history of the repository. This will show you a list of all the commits that have been made to the repository, along with information about the changes that were made in each commit. You can then use the "git checkout" command to revert the repository to a previous commit, which will restore the files to their previous versions.

It's important to note, however, that this process will only work if you have committed and pushed changes to the repository before syncing. If you have not done so, the previous versions of the files will not be available in the repository and may be lost. Therefore, it's always a good idea to make regular backups of your files and to commit and push changes to the repository frequently to avoid data loss.

- Q: OK, my question is this: I have two repositories A and B online under my GitHub account, and both are synced with two local folders through GitHub desktop app. Somehow, I copy all the files in A into the local folder for B. guess what happened to my B repository online?

- A: If you copy all the files from repository A into the local folder for repository B and then sync the changes using the GitHub Desktop app, it is likely that the files in repository B will be overwritten by the files from repository A.

This is because the sync process will compare the files in the local folder with the files in the online repository and update any differences accordingly. Since the files in the local folder now match those from repository A, the sync process will overwrite the files in repository B with those from repository A.

To avoid this kind of issue, it's important to be careful when copying files between repositories or local folders. It's always a good idea to double-check that you are copying the files to the correct location before syncing any changes. Additionally, you can create backups of your repositories to protect against accidental changes or data loss.

- Q: my repository B does not change at all, while repository A changed accordingly. It is like local folder B is like the another local folder A: both local folders share the same repository online

- A: If both local folders are synced with the same online repository, it is likely that the changes you made to the files in local folder A were synced to the online repository, and then synced back down to local folder B when you synced changes from the online repository.

In this case, the files in local folder B would be replaced with the updated versions from the online repository, which would match the versions in local folder A. This would explain why the files in repository B did not change even though you copied the files from repository A to the local folder for repository B.

To confirm this, you can check the commit history for the online repository to see if the changes you made in local folder A were committed and pushed to the repository. If they were, you should see the updated files in local folder B the next time you sync changes from the online repository.

- Q: I wonder if there is any file in the local folder to control which online repository it would sync with? My goal is to transform all the files in local folder A except the control file into local folder B.

- A: Yes, there is a file in the local folder that controls which online repository it syncs with. This file is called ".git/config" and it contains information about the remote repository that the local folder is synced with, including the repository URL and authentication credentials if required.

To transform all the files in local folder A except the control file into local folder B, you can follow these steps:

Make a copy of the control file and move it to local folder B.
Delete the control file from local folder A.
Make any necessary changes to the files in local folder A.
Use the GitHub Desktop app to commit and push the changes to the online repository for local folder A.
Use the GitHub Desktop app to pull the changes from the online repository for local folder A into local folder B.
When you pull the changes from the online repository into local folder B, the files in local folder A that you modified will be synced to the online repository, but the control file will not be included since it was deleted. When you pull the changes into local folder B, the modified files will be downloaded and merged with the existing files in local folder B.

Note that this assumes that both local folders are synced with the same online repository. If the local folders are synced with different online repositories, you will need to ensure that you are committing and pushing changes to the correct repository for local folder A.
