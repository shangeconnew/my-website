I am trying to import a big `STATA` data set into `R`, but the size is over 5m which is the limit for `R`. I wonder if you could help me with that? Actually, the whole data set is available [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/kdx7bdwbrs/1)

The problem is solved by [ Click on the broom icon in the top right window to remove all objects from the environment.](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/prepare-your-data-for-analysis/data-preparation/large-datasets-r/).

When I export the data out of `R` by using code:
```
library("writexl")
write_xlsx(GEIH_17_20_complete, "GEIH_17_20_complete.xlsx")
```
I get this error message:

```
Error: Error in libxlsxwriter: 'Zip error ZIP_BADZIPFILE (use_zip64 option may be required).
```
I edit the code as:

```
library("writexl")
write_xlsx(GEIH_17_20_complete, "GEIH_17_20_complete.xlsx",use_zip64 = TRUE)
```
It works; but the excel file is over 700m; so I cannot open it.
