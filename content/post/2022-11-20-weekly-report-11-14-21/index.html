<p>I got to know the term about former first lady Michelle Obama at <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/28/1132230093/michelle-obamas-best-advice-on-marriage-parenting-and-being-your-authentic-self">NPR</a>; I did not know what it means. So I got to know this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/12/that-feeling-when-you-feel-seen/621050/">article</a>.</p>
