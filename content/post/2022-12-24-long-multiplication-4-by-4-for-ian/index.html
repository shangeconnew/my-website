<h2>Long Multiplication of <span class="math inline">\(4\times 4\)</span></h2>
<p>Ian told me that he could do it; and he even shared with me a story: some fifty graders in Bergman asked third graders to do the long multiplication, whoever did it right, his/her name would show up in the list on the wall of cafetiere. He did it right and his name was in the list; but his friend Issac failed.</p>
<p>To verify what he said, I gave him a question and he got it right:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I also gave him three other questions from <a href="https://www.superteacherworksheets.com/">supperteacheworksheets</a>, he got all right.</p></li>
<li><p>He also did the reading test: <a href="https://www.superteacherworksheets.com/reading-comp/4th-snow-elephants.pdf">Snow Elephants</a>. the result is not that good.</p></li>
<li><p>He also made a snow ball:
