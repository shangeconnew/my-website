## Long Multiplication of $4\times 4$

Ian told me that he could do it; and he even shared with me a story: some fifty graders in Bergman asked third graders to do the long multiplication, whoever did it right, his/her name would show up in the list on the wall of cafetiere. He did it right and his name was in the list; but his friend Issac failed.

To verify what he said, I gave him a question and he got it right:

- I also gave him three other questions from [supperteacheworksheets](https://www.superteacherworksheets.com/), he got all right.

- He also did the reading test: [Snow Elephants](https://www.superteacherworksheets.com/reading-comp/4th-snow-elephants.pdf). the result is not that good.

- He also made a snow ball:
