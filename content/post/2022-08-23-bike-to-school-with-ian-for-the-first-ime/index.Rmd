- It's the firs time for me to bike to school with Ian today. I went to bed around 10pm last night and got up around 8am this morning. The weather is very good and we biked to school together. On the way, Ian told me that he's the only one who knew the word "perseverance". I thought I told him the word when we talked about the [Mars rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseverance_(rover)) before, but he totally forgot it when I questioned him about it. He told me that I asked him to be a person with perseverance, "do not give up easily!"

- That reminded me a story a long time ago. When I was in high school,30 years ago exactly, my best friend Wangkai gave us a talk. In his talk, he mentioned two words: intelligence and perseverance. That's the first time I knew the word. In my opinion, he is the right person with both characteristics.

- we (three of us) saw a movie with cub Scott this evening. The title is [**DC League of Super Pets**](https://www.dcleagueofsuperpets.com/):

The movie is interesting, but both of us fell asleep.
