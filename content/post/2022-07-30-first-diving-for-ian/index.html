<h2>Today it is the first time</h2>
<p>for Ian to diving:about three years ago, I tried to ask him to dive at KSU Natatorium, but he was too scared to do so. I was so jealous of John because Summer can do it back then. John post her diving video in his Wechat moment.</p>

<h2>Thanks for their help.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>First, I should thank Summer. She is the first person to push Ian to dive: she blocks the stairs when Ian wants to back down.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, I should thank Jennifer. She shows Ian that she can do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Last, I should thank Michael. He dives even from the high board. “I am younger than you and I can dive!” that is what he said to Ian.</p></li>
