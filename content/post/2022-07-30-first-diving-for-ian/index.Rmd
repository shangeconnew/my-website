## Today it is the first time 

for Ian to diving:about three years ago, I tried to ask him to dive at KSU Natatorium, but he was too scared to do so. I was so jealous of John because Summer can do it back then. John post her diving video in his Wechat moment.

- First Diving at 5:38pm in the city park pool

## Thanks for their help.

- First, I should thank Summer. She is the first person to push Ian to dive: she blocks the stairs when Ian wants to back down.

- Second, I should thank Jennifer. She shows Ian that she can do it.

- Last, I should thank Michael. He dives even from the high board. "I am younger than you and I can dive!" that is what he said to Ian.
