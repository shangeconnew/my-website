I took the airline two times from Wuhan to Hongkong; and last summer, I found a nice deal even from San Francisco to Hongkong. At that time, I did not know the Chinese name of it. Recently I got this news from `wechat` moment:

It prompts me to think about why its Chinese name is GUOTAI; the answer from `ChatGPT` is as follows:

With that said, the chinese name should be `国太` instead of `国泰`.
