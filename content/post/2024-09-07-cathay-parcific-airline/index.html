<p>I took the airline two times from Wuhan to Hongkong; and last summer, I found a nice deal even from San Francisco to Hongkong. At that time, I did not know the Chinese name of it. Recently I got this news from <code>wechat</code> moment:

<p>It prompts me to think about why its Chinese name is GUOTAI; the answer from <code>ChatGPT</code> is as follows:</p>

<p>With that said, the chinese name should be <code>国太</code> instead of <code>国泰</code>.</p>
