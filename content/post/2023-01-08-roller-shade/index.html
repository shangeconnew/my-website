<p>Very interesting, all the shades in Ian’s room, my room and Nainai’s room do not work: mine does not roll up and the rest two do not stay up.</p>
<p>I got to know the name of roller shade from Homedopte. We have to replace the Ian’s with a old one which I don’t like. For mine, I have roll it up by hand very day. Almost two weeks passed by, I really want to fix it.</p>
<p>I finally figured out the machenism by this <a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/repair/how-to-repair-windows4.htm">article</a>. Also, I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVRhdCnxNhw">YouTube video</a> which is a little lousy. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PreTnSDlFlY">video</a> is better.</p>
<ul>
<li>I fixed mine first and it took me almost two hours to fix Ian’s. Since I opened the cape the of the flat pin side, I have to order one to prepare for emergency. The width is 64 inches, which I can only find <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/iFit-Cut-to-Width-64-5-in-W-x-73-in-L-Beige-Cordless-Blackout-Polyester-Fabric-Roller-Shade-64522/302199447">64.5</a>. But I decide to try the <a href="https://www.draperyworldandblinds.com/">local store</a> first.</li>
</ul>
