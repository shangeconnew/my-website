Very interesting, all the shades in Ian's room, my room and Nainai's room do not work: mine does not roll up and the rest two do not stay up.

I got to know the name of roller shade from Homedopte. We have to replace the Ian's with a old one which I don't like. For mine, I have roll it up by hand very day. Almost two weeks passed by, I really want to fix it.

I finally figured out the machenism by this [article](https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/repair/how-to-repair-windows4.htm). Also, I watched the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVRhdCnxNhw) which is a little lousy. This [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PreTnSDlFlY) is better.

- I fixed mine first and it took me almost two hours to fix Ian's. Since I opened the cape the of the flat pin side, I have to order one to prepare for emergency. The width is 64 inches, which I can only find [64.5](https://www.homedepot.com/p/iFit-Cut-to-Width-64-5-in-W-x-73-in-L-Beige-Cordless-Blackout-Polyester-Fabric-Roller-Shade-64522/302199447). But I decide to try the [local store](https://www.draperyworldandblinds.com/) first.
