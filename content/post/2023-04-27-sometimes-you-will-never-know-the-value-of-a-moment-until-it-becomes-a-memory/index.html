<p>Ian told me this quote from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/photo-stories/10-quotes-by-dr-seuss-that-can-inspire-you-to-change-the-world/photostory/68410852.cms?picid=68410916">Dr. Seuss</a></p>
<p>It just reminds me the moments I stayed with my dad.</p>
<p>Also, we attended the party at Bergman.</p>
