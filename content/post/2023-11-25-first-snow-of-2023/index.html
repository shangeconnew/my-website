<li><p>Today, we witness the first snow of the year. I cleaned the snow in the afternoon while Ian was making a big snow ball. We really enjoyed the time together, especially for me.</p></li>
<li><p>We even planed to go swimming, but he did not want to go; I did drive to Genesis, but failed at last since the road was closed.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I figured out the example about wavelet in Nonparametric statistics.</p></li>
