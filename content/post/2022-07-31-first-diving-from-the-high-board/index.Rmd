## Today Ian keeps the momentum 

and diving for his first time from the high board in the city park pool.

On 8/9/2022(Tuesday), I swim together with Ian after his swimming lesson with Meredith Graves <gravessitting@gmail.com> ; to be honest, it is really scaring to dive from the high board. I tried two times before success.

- Ian's favorite music in the pool is Eric Church - [Springsteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2gGXlW6wSY)
