In English, it is used to refer to a method of argumentation where one disproves a proposition by showing that its logical conclusion leads to absurd or contradictory results. This approach is commonly used in logic and debate to demonstrate the invalidity of an argument.</p>

In Chinese grammar and rhetoric, 反问句 (fǎn wèn jù) is a type of question used to express an idea indirectly, prompt reflection, or emphasize a point, much like in English. It serves similar purposes in communication and writing as rhetorical questions do in English.</code></pre>
