- "反证法"

ChatGPT3.5: "reductio ad absurdum" is a Latin phrase that has been adopted into English. In English, it is used to refer to a method of argumentation where one disproves a proposition by showing that its logical conclusion leads to absurd or contradictory results. This approach is commonly used in logic and debate to demonstrate the invalidity of an argument.

Also, we could refer to [Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum); and pronounce it in [Merrian-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reductio%20ad%20absurdum)

```
"反问句" is indeed a term in Chinese. It translates to "rhetorical question" in English. In Chinese grammar and rhetoric, 反问句 (fǎn wèn jù) is a type of question used to express an idea indirectly, prompt reflection, or emphasize a point, much like in English. It serves similar purposes in communication and writing as rhetorical questions do in English.

- "逆否命题" 

```
(ní fǒu mìng tí) in Chinese refers to "contrapositive" in English. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the subject and predicate and reversing their order. It is an important concept in mathematical and logical reasoning, often used in proofs and argumentation.

In [Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition), it is `Contraposition`.
