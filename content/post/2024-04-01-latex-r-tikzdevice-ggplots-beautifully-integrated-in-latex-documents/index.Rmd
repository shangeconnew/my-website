- First of all, I made two tries:

1. `coinProp.tex` and `tree.tex`: `C:\Users\sshang\OneDrive - Kansas State University\STAT350_Spr24\Slides\Lect6(Intro to probability)`

2. `dist_mean.tex`: `C:\Users\sshang\OneDrive - Kansas State University\STAT350_Spr24\Slides\Lec15(Sampling dist of mean)`

They both work, but I don't know how to change the size of the graph.

- From this [post](https://iltabiai.github.io/tips/latex/2015/09/15/latex-tikzdevice-r.html), we can adjust the font size of the plot title and axis legend and their positions.
