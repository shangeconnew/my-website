<p>Today, Ian told me several animal names which has Latin roots:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Praying mantis: mantis is the Latin word for “bug”</p></li>
<li><p>angler fish: angler is the Latin word for “lantern”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But this turns out to be not right: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanternfish">lanternfish</a> is different. Also, mantis means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis">“prophet”</a>, and angler means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish">“bait”</a>.</p>
<p>When I told him two days later, he said he goth the information from internet. He even messed up prophet with profit. He said daily prophet in Harry Potter. But I stick to “daily profit”. Actually, he is right with the Harry Porter thing: <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Daily_Prophet">daily prophet</a> is a newspaper!</p>
