Today, Ian told me several animal names which has Latin roots:

1. Praying mantis: mantis is  the Latin word for "bug"

2. angler fish: angler is the Latin word for "lantern"

But this turns out to be not right: [lanternfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanternfish) is different. Also, mantis means ["prophet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis), and angler means ["bait"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish).

When I told him two days later, he said he goth the information from internet. He even messed up prophet with profit. He said daily prophet in Harry Potter. But I stick to "daily profit". Actually, he is right with the Harry Porter thing: [daily prophet](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Daily_Prophet) is a newspaper!
