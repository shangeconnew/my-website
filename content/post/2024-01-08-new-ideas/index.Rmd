## website for pictures of trash

Use a smart phone to take a picture of trash, especially plastic trash and post the it the website with the location information. We could do it with at least two purposes:

- We could get the location information for those trash and people could clean them with a place to go;

- We could have an idea about which city is cleaner than the rest; we could calculate an index of the trash based on the number of pictures.
