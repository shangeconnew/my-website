<div id="website-for-pictures-of-trash" class="section level2">
<h2>website for pictures of trash</h2>
<p>Use a smart phone to take a picture of trash, especially plastic trash and post the it the website with the location information. We could do it with at least two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We could get the location information for those trash and people could clean them with a place to go;</p></li>
<li><p>We could have an idea about which city is cleaner than the rest; we could calculate an index of the trash based on the number of pictures.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
