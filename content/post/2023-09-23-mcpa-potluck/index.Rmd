The **Trio**, sometimes known as the **Golden Trio**, was the popular name given to the gang of three best friends and former Gryffindor students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Trio was made up of Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger. The trio was allied with the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army, and Albus Dumbledore in the Second Wizarding War. In their adult lives they helped revolutionise and reform the British Ministry of Magic. They each had a Chocolate Frog Card in their Honours.
