- Email from Ms. Carla Johnston

In her email to my yahoo email:

```
Good afternoon,

Attached is Ian’s progress report, a picture of his project, and a ‘draft’ copy of his IEP.  We will update/correct the IEP during his meeting next week.   I’m looking forward to visiting with you.

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Carla

You could access [the progress report](/pdf/FB-Ian.pdf): I cannot believe that he has finished three projects so far.

- For the Komodo dragon diorama, I remember we carried it from school after I picked him last semester. On the way, we talked a lot about it.  


- I am very interested in the `Lego mindstorm robotic vehicle` and would like to know more about it. I think it is pretty much like the project done by Waren mention his dad.
