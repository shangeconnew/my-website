<p>In her email to my yahoo email:</p>
<pre><code>Good afternoon,

Attached is Ian’s progress report, a picture of his project, and a ‘draft’ copy of his IEP.  We will update/correct the IEP during his meeting next week.   I’m looking forward to visiting with you.

Thanks and have a great weekend!

<li><p>For the Komodo dragon diorama, I remember we carried it from school after I picked him last semester. On the way, we talked a lot about it.</p></li>
<li><p>I am very interested in the <code>Lego mindstorm robotic vehicle</code> and would like to know more about it. I think it is pretty much like the project done by Waren mention his dad.</p></li>
