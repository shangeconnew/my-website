## 9.11

On this historical day, Ian interviewed me and his mom for his homework from Ms. Wade. I shared with him my experience-I first learned it from VOA and then watched it on TV in our neighbor's apartment. Today at home he showed me a nice picture he made at school (more precisely he colored it in predetermined picture).

## two stories

First, Ian shared with me his story at school. Two girls made their presentations bidding for the president of their class. One is his best friend, but her voice is too low and so many "ah" sounds in her presentation,which made her undervalued. Also, her poster is too detailed to catch attend from the class. The other speaks much louder and her presentation is more successful. 

Ian also said the first girl copied most of her post from her older brother's; and she was honest and admitted it to the whole class. Ian said he knew it before her confession since he knew her brother's post when he was playing date with her in her house the day before yesterday. In contrast, one boy in his class is not that honest: his poster was written in cursive letters which were from hands of adults, but he said he did it himself. One girl even tested if it is true: he asked him to expel one word from his poster-extraordinary; he misspelled the word even after 7 tries!

Ian said he would make his presentation tomorrow with the rest of class. He has to recite the speech text first since he would speak without it. On the way, I asked him to try it while walking but he said he would do it "in front of mom". I said he is fine to speak with text even [President Obama was doing it](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-truth-about-presidents-and-teleprompters/). Unfortunately, he did not do it after swimming.

Second, I shared my story with Ian on our way home after his swimming. Yesterday, we left his swimming board in the man's locker room. I knew it no sooner than our car stopped in the garage. But I was so tired and hungry and tired to fetch it immediately; I said to myself: "I will do it after I finish the dinner."  While after dinner, I went down to the basement to take a nap; it was 3am in the morning when I woke up. So I had to give it up. When we got at the locker room around 5:30pm today, I found nothing there. I went to talk with the lady in the front desk and she found nothing there either. I was so regretful and went the media room to work for my teaching tomorrow. About 5 minutes later, a gentleman entered the room and I knew he was working there, so I asked him if he could help me with that. But he said he put it in one of the lockers. That was way beyond my expectation. What's a day for me! 

After I finished my story, I told Ian that never give up if you want to do something-you never know what would happen.

Today I also finished the draft of sports analytics syllabus.
