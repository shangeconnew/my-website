1. This morning, I was trying install `oi_biostat_data` for STAT701, but I got the error message:

```
Using GitHub PAT from the git credential store.
Error: Failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub:
  HTTP error 401.
  Bad credentials
```

With the help of ChatGPT, `devtools::install_github("username/repo", auth_token = "YOUR_PAT")`; I used the following code and it worked:

```
devtools::install_github("username/repo", auth_token = "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")
```
I got the `PAT` with the help of ChatGPT also. Actually, I tried the help from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70908295/failed-to-install-unknown-package-from-github) but failed.

2. I don't understand how it works fully!
