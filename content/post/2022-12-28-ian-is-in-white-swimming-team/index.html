<h2>Ian is in white team</h2>
<p>Yesterday after swimming, he told me that Summer will test for white today. After I comfirmed that he would like to give it try also, I contacted Dr. Shen immediately-she told me that Coach Miles would take care of that. So we went to Genesis several minutes ahead of 7pm, I talked with Coach Miles and he said “Yes!”</p>
<p>Ian was very excited and had been trying his best to pass the test. Around 8pm, I talked with Coach Reid and Miles, both of them smiled to me that Ian passed the test and he is white now. On our way home, Ian told me that he was not tired and had been nervous. I regret that I did not take any phote of his swimming.</p>
<p>I did take a video and several photos when I picked him up at the zoo camp. I arrived there around 5:05 and he asked if we could stay for 10 more minutes. I said yes and wintnessed the whole process.</p>
