<p>I tried to search Raz kids reading in my Baidu drive, but I found some mp3 audios both in Chinese and English. I am trying to look for the book in a local library, but I failed. When I googled it with <strong>E. O. Plauen</strong> , and ended with nothing. When I tried <strong>Erich Ohser</strong>, I got the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Plauen">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>The book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_and_Son_(comics)">Wikipedia</a> says the father is plump and bald; Plump is a new word for me, I googled it and get the <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/beer-belly">Beer belly</a>.</p>
<p>On our way to Manhattan Youth Symphony, I tested Ian for the word and he knew it!</p>
