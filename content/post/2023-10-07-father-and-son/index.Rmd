I tried to search Raz kids reading in my Baidu drive, but I found some mp3 audios both in Chinese and English. I am trying to look for the book in a local library, but I failed. When I googled it with **E. O. Plauen** , and ended with nothing. When I tried **Erich Ohser**, I got the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Plauen)

The book [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_and_Son_(comics)) says the father is plump and bald; Plump is a new word for me, I googled it and get the [Beer belly](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/beer-belly). 

On our way to Manhattan Youth Symphony, I tested Ian for the word and he knew it!
