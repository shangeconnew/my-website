- 11/5/2023, this is a bad day for me. But I know the Chris guy bullied other students in the class and I was very mad. Obviously he learned the curse words from Chris.

- 12/14/2023, this is a bad day for me. Ian did not want to go to bed at 10:03pm; I said you could survey all of your peers around our house; he said there're only three kids. I said you could survey your classmates tomorrow, he said Francisco went to bed after 10pm. I set up the three rules

1. go to bed by 9:30pm everyday;

2. no food and video at the same time;

3. at least one exercise a day.
