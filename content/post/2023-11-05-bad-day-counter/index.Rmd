- 12/14/2023, this is a bad day for me. Ian did not want to go to bed at 10:03pm; I said you could survey all of your peers around our house; he said there're only three kids. I said you could survey your classmates tomorrow, he said Francisco went to bed after 10pm. I set up the three rules

1. go to bed by 9:30pm everyday;

2. no food and video at the same time;

3. at least one exercise a day.

- 2/24/2024. One day before, he lied to his mom that he put the egg into the toilet. The reason is that the egg is mixed with milk. Several days before this, he just changed the date of an old composition and lied to his mom as the new one. With the two lies, especially the second one, I was very upset. And today, he keeps playing with mom's cellphone while eating. I warmed him two time, but he cannot stop.

- 4/11/2024. He was reluctant to share with me anything about the music memory, and he hit me at least three times.
