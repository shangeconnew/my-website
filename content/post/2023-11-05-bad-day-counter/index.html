<ul>
<li><p>11/5/2023, this is a bad day for me. But I know the Chris guy bullied other students in the class and I was very mad. Obviously he learned the curse words from Chris.</p></li>
<li><p>12/14/2023, this is a bad day for me. Ian did not want to go to bed at 10:03pm; I said you could survey all of your peers around our house; he said thereâ€™re only three kids. I said you could survey your classmates tomorrow, he said Francisco went to bed after 10pm. I set up the three rules</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>go to bed by 9:30pm everyday;</p></li>
<li><p>no food and video at the same time;</p></li>
<li><p>at least one exercise a day.</p></li>
</ol>
