Today, I went to Bergman as a volunteer for the book fair. With the help from Ms. Crawfield, I worked as a cashier. I finished 4 orders and I bought 3 books, one for Ian and the other two for Ms. Wade from her wish list.

In the library, I found this picture very interesting:

I also talked with Ms Wade and got the evaluation sheet which was requested from Ian's mom. The most important thing is that I visited the gym which had been mentioned a lot by Ian. Among four lists, Ian got his name mentioned in two of them, Pacer test and sit-up.

At the beginning, I messed up the time as from 4 to 5pm; since the recitation sheet for stat350 was not ready yet, I almost gave up. On that moment, I had three things on my to do list at least:

1. Finish the recitation sheet;

2. Wash the dishes;

3. Volunteering for the book fair.

I put the priority to job 3 and I came home around 5pm. After some food, I finish the other two jobs. The only problem is that the recitation sheet was uploaded to Canvas around 6pm.

I also found Ian's picture in the hall way; his mom spent a lot of time looking for it on the parent teacher conference yesterday but she failed. I guess Ms. Wade did some homework after the conference and she showed it to me:

I like the gym the most, especially the whiteboard which has the lines written by students about `How do you help make your friends and family feel happy?`

And the line in this rope picture: **Brain is like muscle; when I exercise it, it gets stronger.**
