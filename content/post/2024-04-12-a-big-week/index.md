## Music Memory

- On out way home, I intentionally asked him questions about the competition, but he was a little upset and refused to talk further. I was a little upset also and we had an argument. I already got the pictures of the competition from Ms. Lebbin:

- Later, he told us that he got the perfect score, but did not get the bonus question right. Later (9/14/2024), I found his test paper:

- He was wearing a t-shirt only when I saw him at the backyard of Bergman; it's very windy and that's the reason to get cold.

## Swimming next day

Even though he got a cold, but he tried his best to swim fast. He is really a good kid!
