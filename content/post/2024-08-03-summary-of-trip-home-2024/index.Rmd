- We went back on 5/23/24 and returned 7/31. For the trip from Hongkong to Wuhan, we took the train and flight with Cathy Pacific for the return.

- The VIP service from Hongkong to Shenzhen is really good even though it's a little expensive (\(\yen\)1100)

- Ian got sick twice and we went to three hospitals. It is really unforgettable experience.

- Next time, we should buy Cathy Pacific airline ticket so that Wuhan could be connected together. To go through HK custom twice is really a pain.
