## Ian's $10^{th}$ birthday

- It's very nice to have his birthday on Sunday. We did not throw a party; we only invited Jennifer and Achilles home. A cake was purchased from Wal Mart and a pizza was bought for dinner.

- Ian is happy, but he claimed this is the first time he would be at age of two digits.
